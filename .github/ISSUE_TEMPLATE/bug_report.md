### Hey there! Ignite Bowser seems to be having a problem, eh?

Welllllll, it just might be. First, search the issues to make sure it's not already
here, and if not head over to http://community.infinite.red to
get some help. If you've identified that it's really an Ignite Bowser issue, then:

- Explain what's going on and preferably how to replicate the issue (bonus points for a repro app)
- Run `ignite doctor` and paste the result below, including the lines with 3 backticks
- Delete these instructions! We don't want to look at them. ;)
